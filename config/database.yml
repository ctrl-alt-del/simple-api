# MySQL.  Versions 5.0+ are recommended.
#
# Install the MYSQL driver
#   gem install mysql2
#
# Ensure the MySQL gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'mysql2'
#
# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:

default: &default
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8
  pool: 5
  host: localhost
  username: root
  password: root
  timeout: 5000

development:
  <<: *default
  database: simple-api_development

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  <<: *default
  database: simple-api_test

# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: simple-api_production
  username: simple-api
  password: <%= ENV['SIMPLE-API_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>


# ===============================================================================
# After running "rails generate devise:install"
#
# Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

#   1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
#      is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
#      in config/environments/development.rb:

#        config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost:3000' }

#      In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

#   2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
#      For example:

#        root to: "home#index"

#   3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
#      For example:

#        <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
#        <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

#   4. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

#        config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

#      On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
#      or load models when precompiling your assets.

#   5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

#        rails g devise:views
